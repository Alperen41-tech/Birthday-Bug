# Birthday-Bug
A desktop application developed by me (Written in Java).
My purpose was to create a personalized birthday celebration.
The application consists of various UI pages where users interact with a bug and barriers. User
tries to keep the bug away from the barriers for 15 seconds. If user succeeds, users receive a
surprise birthday message.
Requirements: Calculating bug and barrier coordinates simultaneously, Handling user input from
keyboard or mouse
